So, I was writing this method in a battleship game I'm working on, then I encountered a bug - the code inside the first if statement wasn't working. Not until I commented out the first line in the code. I ended up changing its position - putting it as the last line before the next 'if' statement. 

My question is - "Why doesn't it work if "ship.hits(index) = "hit";" is at the top?"


fire: function (guess) {
        for (var i = 0; i < this.numShips; i++)// <-- iterate thru all ships 
        {
            let ship = this.ships[i]; // access each ships array
            let index = ship.locations.indexOf(guess); // grab the index of 'guess' in the locations array. index will be < 0 if guess is not in locations array 
           

//----------------------------------------------------------below code----------------------

 if (index >= 0) {
		ship.hits(index) = "hit"; // if the guess is in the locations array, update the corresponding 'hits' index to "hit"
                view.displayHit(guess);
                view.displayMsg('HIT!');
                

//--------------------------------------------------------------above code-------------------



                if (this.isSunk(ship)) { //<-- if a ship gets sunk, 
                    view.displayMsg("YOU SANK MY BATTLESHIP! ðŸ˜’")
                    this.shipsSunk++; //increment the shipsSunk property
                }
                return true;
            }

        }
        view.displayMiss(guess);
        view.displayMsg("MISSED ME! HAHA!ðŸ˜‚");
        return false;
    }
